## **Description**

- This is a Lead acid battery charger with maximum charging current 1A. It has two stages of charging. Initially it charges the battery from a constant current below 1A and gets 
battery voltage to appropriate level. Then it changes the charging mode to constant voltage, to gradually reduce the current into the battery.

- Method of constant current and constant voltage is based on **Feedback control** and the **PWM Technique** . We were only allowed to use Operational Amplifiers as an Integrated 
circuits ( IC ) and any other passive electronic component.
